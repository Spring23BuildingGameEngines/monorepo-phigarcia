## Debugging

Edit the following lines below and list two things you learned about debugging (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" or "effort based" exercise meaning, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced two things about debugging and have knowledge of how to use a debugger.

1. *I didn't know you could reload a file. This whole time I've been restarting gdb whenever I edit my code!*
2. *I also didn't know about the text user interface. This is really neat and I'd definitely use it in the future.*
