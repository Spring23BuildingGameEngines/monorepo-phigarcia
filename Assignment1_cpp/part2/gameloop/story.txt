It's a stormy day.
You decide to go outside, for some reason.
Who's this?
A small, muddy kitten approaches you.
You decide to take it inside.
You give the kitten a bath. He hates this. 
The kitten allows you to bathe him.
You dry him off. He is appreciative!
You set him up inside, and go to bed.
The next morning, you try to find the kitten's owner.
He has no tag or collar, so you take him back home.
You now have a new furry friend!
